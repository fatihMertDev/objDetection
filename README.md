ObjectDetection
This repository implements a custom object detection model using Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, pre-trained on ImageNet. While a similar version of this model is available in PyTorch's official tutorials, this implementation explores a unique approach by modifying the backbone architecture, optimizing the anchor generation, and adjusting key configurations. The model was trained and tested on the Penn-Fudan Pedestrian dataset, which contains labeled images of pedestrians.
